# Task ID: 1
# Title: Complete Database Seeding and Sample Content Generation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Populate the database with comprehensive sample data including courses, users, lessons, and test content to enable full platform functionality testing
# Details:
Create Prisma seed script (prisma/seed.ts) with realistic sample data: 1) Generate 50+ sample courses across Unity, Unreal, and Godot with proper categories and difficulty levels 2) Create test user accounts for all roles (students, instructors, admins) with proper OAuth integration 3) Add sample course modules and lessons with placeholder video content 4) Generate mock payment records and license keys for testing enrollment flows 5) Include forum posts, reviews, and user progress data 6) Ensure all database relationships are properly populated with referential integrity

# Test Strategy:
Run seed script and verify: database contains sample courses accessible via API, user authentication works with seeded accounts, course enrollment flows function with sample license keys, all relationships properly established without foreign key errors
