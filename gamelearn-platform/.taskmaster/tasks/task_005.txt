# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Game Engine Integration and Project Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot integration features for seamless project import/export and version control
# Details:
Create game engine integrations: 1) Unity Hub integration with automatic project setup and package management 2) Unreal Engine .uproject file handling with Blueprint and C++ templates 3) Godot project structure support with GDScript integration 4) WebGL build pipeline for automatic game deployment and hosting 5) Version control integration (Git) with visual diff tools for binary assets 6) Asset management system with thumbnail previews and metadata 7) Project templates library for different game types 8) Cloud-based development environment setup with pre-configured engine versions

# Test Strategy:
Verify engine integrations: create new projects in each engine, import/export projects successfully, WebGL builds deploy correctly, version control tracks changes properly, asset management functions across all supported engines
