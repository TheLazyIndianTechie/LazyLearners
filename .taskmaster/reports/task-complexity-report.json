			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down Task 27 into approximately 7 detailed subtasks covering analytics data modeling, backend aggregation services, frontend dashboard shell, individual metric modules, comparative analysis tooling, real-time update infrastructure, and cross-cutting QA/performance validation. For each subtask, specify objectives, key deliverables, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Requires coordinated frontend and backend work for multiple analytics domains, real-time updates, exports, and shared filtering, demanding significant cross-cutting architecture and testing."

			"taskTitle": "Build course performance metrics dashboard and shared analytics shell",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose Task 27.1 into about 6 actionable subtasks covering shared UI shell creation, state management and comparator controls, backend aggregation endpoints with caching, real-time data streaming setup, data validation/loading states, and QA/performance benchmarking. Provide clear deliverables and acceptance tests for each.",
			"reasoning": "Combines foundational UI framework, backend aggregation, and real-time data handling, which together create substantial architectural and implementation effort."

			"taskTitle": "Add revenue analytics with Recharts",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand Task 27.2 into roughly 5 subtasks addressing revenue data modeling and ETL, metric computation logic, chart/table UI implementation, permission/masking enforcement, and validation/testing for accuracy and performance. Define outputs and acceptance criteria per subtask.",
			"reasoning": "Financial analytics introduces complex aggregation, currency handling, security, and rich visualization needs, raising both backend and frontend complexity."

			"taskId": 27.3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement student engagement metrics",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break Task 27.3 into around 5 subtasks covering telemetry ingestion and preprocessing, engagement metric aggregation, cohort/filter logic, visualization components, and privacy/performance testing with representative datasets. Detail deliverables and validation steps for each.",
			"reasoning": "Requires diverse data sources, cohort analytics, and privacy-aware aggregation paired with multiple visualizations, making coordination intensive."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose Task 27.4 into about 4 subtasks addressing retention data pipeline, API endpoints for video summaries, visualization/UI components for retention and dropout insights, and integration/testing with engagement drill-through. Include acceptance criteria per subtask.",
			"reasoning": "Focused scope on video telemetry but still requires data preprocessing, specialized visualizations, and integration with broader analytics shell."

			"taskId": 27.5,
			"taskTitle": "Add export functionality and global date range filtering",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split Task 27.5 into approximately 6 subtasks covering global filter UX/state wiring, server-side validation and query propagation, export job service and queue setup, format-specific renderers (CSV/JSON/PDF), notification and secure delivery flow, and comprehensive integration testing/audit logging. Provide deliverables and acceptance criteria for each.",
			"reasoning": "Combines shared filtering, asynchronous export workflows, multiple output formats, and compliance requirements, introducing notable technical and operational complexity."
