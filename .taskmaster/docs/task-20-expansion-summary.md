- **Upload Component:** ✅ Complete with drag-and-drop, progress tracking, polling

### Complexity Assessment
- **Overall Task Complexity:** 9/10 (Very High)
- **Total Estimated Effort:** 78-106 hours (10-13 developer days)
- **Technical Complexity:** 10/10 (video processing, codecs, streaming protocols)
- **Integration Complexity:** 9/10 (FFmpeg, storage, CDN, queue, DRM)
- **Risk Level:** High (format compatibility, scaling costs, infrastructure)

## Recommended Video Processing Approach

### Development & Testing
```
Technology: fluent-ffmpeg + FFmpeg (Node.js)
Reason: Full control, no vendor lock-in, cost-effective
Use Case: Local development, initial testing
```

### Production (Recommended Hybrid)
```
Small Scale (<5,000 videos/month):
  - Self-hosted FFmpeg on VPS
  - Cloudflare R2 Storage (cheaper than S3)
  - Cloudflare CDN (included free)
  - Cost: ~$275-475/month

Large Scale (>5,000 videos/month):
  - AWS MediaConvert (auto-scaling, managed)
  - AWS S3 Storage
  - CloudFront CDN
  - Cost: ~$4,400-8,700/month
```

### Technology Stack Components

## Issues Encountered

Task Master AI MCP tools experienced technical errors during:
- `expand_task` - API error, process exited with code 1
- `analyze_project_complexity` - API error during text generation

**Workaround:** Manual analysis and documentation completed. Subtasks can be added manually to `tasks.json` or via CLI when MCP server stabilizes.
