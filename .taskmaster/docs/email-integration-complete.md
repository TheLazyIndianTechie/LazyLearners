}
```

**Email Content:**

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Queue System:**
- All emails use **BullMQ queue** for reliability
- Graceful fallback to direct send if Redis unavailable
- Retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Rate limiting (10 emails/second)

### **Deduplication:**
- Each email has unique `dedupeKey`
- Prevents duplicate sends (e.g., multiple milestone emails)
- Format: `{template}-user-{userId}-course-{courseId}`

### **Async Processing:**
- Emails queue asynchronously
- Don't block user operations
- Errors logged but don't fail primary operations

### **Error Handling:**
```typescript
queueTemplateEmail(...)
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error queueing email:', error);
    // Operation continues successfully
  });
```

## 📝 Code Examples

// Send custom email
await queueTemplateEmail(
  'user@example.com',
  'enrollment',
  {
    userName: 'John',
    courseName: 'My Course',
    courseUrl: 'https://app.com/courses/123',
    instructorName: 'Jane',
    enrollmentDate: new Date()
  },
  {
    correlationId: 'custom-email-123',
    dedupeKey: 'my-unique-key'
  }
);
```

### **Send Scheduled Email:**
```typescript
await queueTemplateEmail(
  'user@example.com',
  'progress-milestone',
  { /* data */ },
  {
    scheduledFor: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 24 hours
  }
);
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Emails not sending:**
1. Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. Check `EMAIL_DRY_RUN` is `false`
3. Check logs for errors: `console.error('Error queueing email')`
4. Test with `/api/email/test` endpoint

### **Duplicate emails:**
- Deduplication should prevent this
- Check `dedupeKey` is unique per email type
- Clear Redis if issues persist

### **Queue not working:**
- Check Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
- Falls back to direct send automatically
- Set `ENABLE_EMAIL_QUEUE=false` to skip queue
