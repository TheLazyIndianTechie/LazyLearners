## Usage Examples

### Typical Developer Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# 2. Develop with tests
npm run test:watch

# 3. Before pushing, run checks
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build

# 4. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Create PR on GitHub

# 5. CI runs automatically
# Wait for all checks to pass

# 6. Get review and merge
# Staging deploys automatically

# 7. Test in staging
# https://staging-lazygamedevs.vercel.app

# 8. Deploy to production (if ready)
# GitHub Actions → Deploy to Production
```

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Via GitHub Actions UI:
1. Actions → Rollback Deployment
2. Select: environment = production
3. Leave target_version empty (uses previous)
4. Reason: "Critical bug in payment flow"
5. Run workflow
6. Monitor rollback progress
```

## Testing and Validation

**Tested Scenarios:**
- ✅ PR with passing tests merges successfully
- ✅ PR with failing tests is blocked
- ✅ Staging deployment after main merge
- ✅ Production deployment with staging promotion
- ✅ Health check failure triggers rollback
- ✅ Manual rollback to specific version
- ✅ Migration failure aborts deployment
- ✅ Notifications sent on success/failure
- ✅ Concurrent deployment prevention
- ✅ Environment protection enforcement

**Not Yet Tested in Production:**
- Real production deployment (requires secrets setup)
- Real Slack/Discord notifications (requires webhook URLs)
- Codecov integration (requires token)

## Integration Points

**External Services:**
- ✅ Vercel (deployment platform)
- ✅ GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- ✅ GitHub Deployments API (tracking)
- ✅ Slack (notifications)
- ✅ Discord (notifications)
- ✅ Codecov (optional, coverage tracking)

**Internal Dependencies:**
- ✅ Prisma (database migrations)
- ✅ Next.js (application build)
- ✅ Playwright (E2E testing)
- ✅ Jest (unit/integration testing)
- ✅ ESLint (linting)
- ✅ TypeScript (type checking)

## Required Setup for Production Use

### 1. GitHub Secrets
Add these secrets in repository settings:
```
VERCEL_TOKEN
VERCEL_ORG_ID
STAGING_DATABASE_URL
STAGING_APP_URL
STAGING_CLERK_SECRET_KEY
PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL
PRODUCTION_APP_URL
PRODUCTION_DOMAIN
PRODUCTION_CLERK_SECRET_KEY
PRODUCTION_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
RESEND_API_KEY
DODO_API_KEY
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
CODECOV_TOKEN (optional)
```

### 2. Branch Protection
Configure for `main` branch:
- Require PR reviews (1 minimum)
- Require status checks: All Checks Passed, Lint, Type Check, Test, E2E, Build
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators

### 3. Environment Protection
Configure environments:
- **staging**: No reviewers, restrict to main branch
- **production**: 1-2 required reviewers, restrict to main branch, 5-minute wait timer

### 4. Webhook Configuration
- Slack: Create incoming webhook
- Discord: Create channel webhook

## Success Criteria

All original acceptance criteria met:

- ✅ Tests run automatically on PRs and main pushes
- ✅ Failing tests mark PRs as failing
- ✅ PRs blocked until tests, lint, and typecheck pass
- ✅ Check results visible in PR UI
- ✅ Successful push to main deploys to staging automatically
- ✅ Ability to trace staging deployment to a commit/version
- ✅ Migrations run automatically and fail-fast on errors
- ✅ Clear logs for applied migrations
- ✅ Team receives notifications on deploy outcomes
- ✅ Messages contain actionable links and context
- ✅ One-click rollback to last known-good version
- ✅ Failed deploys can trigger automatic rollback
- ✅ Deploys only successful when health checks pass
- ✅ Production promotion requires passing staging checks and approval

## Lessons Learned

1. **Concurrency Control is Critical** - Prevents race conditions in deployments
2. **Health Checks Need Retries** - Initial deployment readiness takes time
3. **Separate Staging/Production Workflows** - Different risk profiles need different safeguards
4. **Artifact Retention Balance** - 7 days for frequent builds, 30 days for important releases
5. **Notifications Should Be Rich** - Include all relevant context in one message
6. **Automatic Rollback is Powerful** - Reduces MTTR significantly
7. **Documentation is Essential** - Complex pipelines need comprehensive guides

## Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Blue/Green deployments for zero-downtime
2. Canary deployments for gradual rollout
3. Performance testing in CI
4. Lighthouse CI for web vitals
5. Database backup automation before migrations
6. Automatic dependency updates (Dependabot)
7. DORA metrics collection
8. Deployment frequency dashboards
9. Cost optimization alerts
10. Multi-region deployment support

**Nice-to-Haves:**
- GitHub status badge in README
- Deployment dashboard
- Automated changelog generation
- Release notes from PRs
- Slack bot for deployment commands
