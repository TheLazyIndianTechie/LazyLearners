## Complexity Analysis

### Overall Task Complexity: 9/10 (Very High)

**Justification:**
- **Technical Complexity (10/10):** Video processing requires deep understanding of codecs, containers, streaming protocols, and distributed systems
- **Integration Complexity (9/10):** Multiple services (FFmpeg, cloud storage, CDN, job queue, DRM)
- **Scale Complexity (8/10):** Must handle concurrent processing, large files, and high bandwidth
- **Operational Complexity (9/10):** Monitoring, error handling, retry logic, cost optimization

### Risk Factors

1. **High**: FFmpeg processing failures due to unsupported formats
2. **High**: Storage costs scaling beyond budget
3. **Medium**: CDN configuration issues causing playback problems
4. **Medium**: Job queue deadlocks or stuck jobs
5. **Low**: DRM integration complexity

### Subtask Complexity Scores

| Subtask | Complexity | Effort (hrs) | Risk |
|---------|-----------|--------------|------|
| 20.1 FFmpeg Integration | 8/10 | 8-12 | High |
| 20.2 Cloud Storage | 7/10 | 10-14 | Medium |
| 20.3 HLS/DASH Manifests | 9/10 | 12-16 | High |
| 20.4 Thumbnail Generation | 5/10 | 6-8 | Low |
| 20.5 Job Queue | 7/10 | 8-10 | Medium |
| 20.6 Metadata Extraction | 4/10 | 4-6 | Low |
| 20.7 Quality Selection | 6/10 | 4-6 | Low |
| 20.8 Progress Tracking | 6/10 | 8-10 | Medium |
| 20.9 DRM/Encryption | 8/10 | 12-16 | High |
| 20.10 CDN Integration | 6/10 | 6-8 | Medium |

**Total Estimated Effort:** 78-106 hours (10-13 developer days)
