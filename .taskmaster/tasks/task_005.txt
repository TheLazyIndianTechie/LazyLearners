# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Game Engine Integration and Project Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot integration features for seamless project import/export and version control
# Details:
Create game engine integrations: 1) Unity Hub integration with automatic project setup and package management 2) Unreal Engine .uproject file handling with Blueprint and C++ templates 3) Godot project structure support with GDScript integration 4) WebGL build pipeline for automatic game deployment and hosting 5) Version control integration (Git) with visual diff tools for binary assets 6) Asset management system with thumbnail previews and metadata 7) Project templates library for different game types 8) Cloud-based development environment setup with pre-configured engine versions

# Test Strategy:
Verify engine integrations: create new projects in each engine, import/export projects successfully, WebGL builds deploy correctly, version control tracks changes properly, asset management functions across all supported engines

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Unity Engine Integration Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build Unity Hub integration with automatic project setup, package management, and version control support
### Details:
Create Unity-specific services including: Unity project creation API endpoint (/api/engine/unity/projects), Unity Hub integration for automatic project setup with proper folder structure, Unity package manager integration for dependency management, Unity version detection and compatibility checking, Unity project file (.unityproject) parsing and manipulation, integration with existing video upload system for Unity tutorials, and WebGL build automation for Unity projects. Include proper validation for Unity project formats and asset handling.

## 2. Implement Unreal Engine Project Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create Unreal Engine .uproject file handling with Blueprint and C++ template support
### Details:
Build Unreal Engine integration including: .uproject file parsing and generation, Blueprint template library with common game patterns, C++ project template support with proper CMake configuration, Unreal Engine version compatibility checking, asset import/export functionality for Unreal projects, integration with existing course management system for Unreal tutorials, automated packaging for WebGL/HTML5 builds, and Visual Studio/Rider IDE integration setup. Support both Blueprint-only and C++ hybrid projects.

## 3. Build Godot Engine Integration Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop Godot project structure support with GDScript integration and scene management
### Details:
Create Godot-specific functionality including: Godot project.godot file handling, GDScript code analysis and syntax highlighting, Godot scene (.tscn) file management, Godot resource (.tres) file support, integration with Godot's built-in version control system, automated HTML5 export for web deployment, Godot plugin management and installation, and C# scripting support for Godot 4.x. Include proper validation for Godot project structure and asset references.

## 4. Implement WebGL Build Pipeline and Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create automated WebGL build system for Unity, Unreal, and Godot projects with hosting integration
### Details:
Build comprehensive WebGL deployment system including: automated build pipeline that detects engine type and uses appropriate build tools, WebGL optimization for different engines (Unity WebGL, Unreal HTML5, Godot HTML5), integration with existing video upload infrastructure for build artifacts, CDN deployment for optimized WebGL builds, build status tracking and logging, progressive loading implementation for large WebGL builds, and mobile-responsive WebGL container. Include build caching and incremental builds for faster iterations.

## 5. Create Git Integration and Asset Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Build version control integration with visual diff tools for binary assets and comprehensive asset management
### Details:
Implement advanced version control and asset management including: Git LFS integration for large binary assets (textures, models, audio), visual diff tools for images and 3D models using existing video processing infrastructure, automated asset thumbnail generation using video processing pipeline, metadata extraction for game assets (textures, audio, models), asset dependency tracking across projects, collaborative asset library with search and filtering, integration with existing portfolio system for asset showcasing, and automated asset optimization pipeline. Include proper handling of engine-specific assets (Unity .prefab, Unreal .uasset, Godot .tres files).
