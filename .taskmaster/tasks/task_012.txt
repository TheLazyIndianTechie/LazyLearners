# Title: Enhanced video player with advanced controls
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add picture-in-picture, playback speed controls, keyboard shortcuts, and quality selector to existing video player component
# Details:
Extend src/components/video/video-player.tsx with Picture-in-Picture API support, speed controls (0.5x-2x), keyboard event handlers (space for play/pause, arrow keys for seek), quality selector dropdown using HTMLVideoElement.videoTracks, closed captions support with WebVTT, and fullscreen API integration. Implement video thumbnail preview on seek using canvas for frame extraction and localStorage for resume position tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for keyboard handlers and control logic, visual regression tests for UI controls, cross-browser compatibility testing, and accessibility testing with screen readers
