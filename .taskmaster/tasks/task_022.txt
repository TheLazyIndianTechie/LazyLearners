# Task ID: 22
# Title: Redis caching implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement Redis caching for expensive queries and user sessions with cache invalidation strategies
# Details:
Integrate Redis using existing REDIS_URL configuration and ioredis client. Cache course catalog data with TTL of 1 hour, user enrollment status with 30-minute TTL, video metadata with 24-hour TTL, and user session data. Implement cache invalidation on course updates, enrollment changes, and user modifications. Add cache warming strategies for popular courses and cache hit/miss monitoring with metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Cache hit/miss ratio testing, cache invalidation verification, performance comparison with/without caching, memory usage monitoring, and cache coherence testing
