Document all issues in a spreadsheet for tracking.\n<info added on 2025-10-03T03:37:52.842Z>\nI need to analyze the codebase structure to better understand the mobile responsiveness audit findings mentioned in the user request.Mobile responsiveness audit completed successfully. Comprehensive analysis of 9 core components across 320px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px breakpoints revealed mixed responsiveness implementation with critical issues requiring immediate attention.\n\nAUDIT RESULTS SUMMARY:\n- Total components audited: 9 core components + 3 pages\n- Issues identified: 27 total (5 critical, 15 medium, 7 minor)\n- Overall mobile responsiveness score: 6/10\n\nCRITICAL FINDINGS:\n1. Video Player Controls (src/components/video/video-player.tsx): ALL control buttons use size=\"sm\" with h-4 w-4 icons, resulting in ~32x32px touch targets - significantly below the 44x44px WCAG minimum requirement. Volume slider at w-20 (80px) width also insufficient for accurate touch interaction.\n\n2. Touch Target Violations: Multiple components have interactive elements below 44x44px minimum, particularly video controls, some course card buttons, and navigation menu toggle.\n\nPOSITIVE FINDINGS:\n1. MainNav component (src/components/layout/main-nav.tsx) demonstrates EXCELLENT mobile implementation: proper responsive breakpoints (hidden md:flex), mobile Sheet menu with 300px-400px width, appropriate auth button handling with hidden sm:flex pattern.\n\n2. Most page layouts use proper responsive grid patterns (md:grid-cols-X lg:grid-cols-Y) and Tailwind responsive prefixes effectively.\n\nLAYOUT ISSUES IDENTIFIED:\n1. Dashboard page TabsList uses grid-cols-4 without mobile breakpoint, causing cramped display on 320px screens\n2. Hero section stats grid uses grid-cols-3 without responsive adjustment\n3. Course page featured categories could benefit from grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 pattern\n\nTYPOGRAPHY CONCERNS:\nFixed font sizes (text-4xl, text-3xl, heading-hero) lack responsive scaling for mobile readability. Recommended responsive classes: text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl pattern.\n\nDetailed audit report with component-specific analysis, touch target measurements, and implementation recommendations documented at .taskmaster/docs/mobile-responsiveness-audit.md. Next priority: Subtask 17.3 (touch targets) and 17.5 (video player mobile optimization) require immediate attention before production deployment.\n</info added on 2025-10-03T03:37:52.842Z>",

Created comprehensive audit documentation at .taskmaster/docs/accessibility-color-contrast-audit.md detailing all color combinations analysis. Critical disabled state opacity issue fixed across all form components (button.tsx, input.tsx, textarea.tsx, checkbox.tsx, select.tsx, radio-group.tsx) by replacing opacity-based styling with explicit color values ensuring 3:1 contrast ratio compliance. Installed @axe-core/playwright v4.10.2 for automated accessibility testing. Built complete test suite at tests/e2e/accessibility/color-contrast.spec.ts with 11 comprehensive test cases covering homepage, courses, dashboard, buttons, form inputs, disabled states, focus indicators, links, navigation, badges, and dark mode scenarios. Added test:accessibility script to package.json for dedicated accessibility testing. Platform achieves 85% compliance with remaining work needed for hover state verification, accent badge colors, and destructive button colors. All primary text (20.5:1), secondary text (15.8:1), button colors (5.8:1-7.1:1), and focus indicators fully compliant.\n</info added on 2025-10-03T08:28:54.856Z>",
