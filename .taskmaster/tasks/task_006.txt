# Title: Develop Real-Time Collaboration and Communication Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement WebSocket-based real-time collaboration tools for multi-user code editing, voice chat, and project synchronization
# Details:
Build collaboration infrastructure: 1) WebSocket server implementation for real-time communication 2) Multi-user code editor with operational transformation and conflict resolution 3) Voice and video chat integration using WebRTC 4) Real-time project synchronization with live cursors and user presence 5) Team management with role-based permissions (programmer, artist, designer) 6) Session recording for collaborative coding sessions 7) Screen sharing functionality for mentorship and debugging 8) Integrated chat with file sharing and code snippet support

# Test Strategy:
Test collaboration features: multiple users edit code simultaneously without conflicts, voice/video chat functions reliably, project changes sync in real-time, session recordings capture all activities properly
