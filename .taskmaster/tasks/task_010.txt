# Task ID: 10
# Title: Optimize Performance and Complete Production Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations, comprehensive monitoring, and complete production deployment with global CDN integration
# Details:
Production optimization and deployment: 1) Performance optimization with bundle analysis and code splitting 2) CDN integration for global asset delivery with 100+ edge locations 3) Database query optimization and connection pooling 4) Comprehensive monitoring with Sentry error tracking and performance metrics 5) Load testing with simulated 10,000+ concurrent users 6) Security audit including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning 7) WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance verification 8) Mobile app preparation with PWA features and offline capabilities 9) Analytics integration for user behavior tracking and conversion optimization

# Test Strategy:
Verify production readiness: platform handles expected load without performance degradation, global CDN delivers content sub-50ms latency, monitoring alerts function properly, security audit passes all checks, accessibility compliance verified with automated and manual testing
